This folder contains a list of assignemnts done during the course of AUE 8230 Autonomy:Sciences and Systems. During the course, we are provided an introduction of Robotic Operating System (ROS) and how we can utilze the open source libraries, modules and frameworks along with ROS in the filed of robotic and autonomous applications. In this course, we will be working with Gazebo, a physics based simulator to perform our simulations and a turtlebot3 burger to run our algorithms. This also a gives us a chance to verify our simulation testing against real world testing.
This repository consists of lab 2 and assignment done during the course for now
